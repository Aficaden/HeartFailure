# Heart Failure Mortality Prediction Objectives

1- Determine the most essential features that are linked with mortality due to heart failure.
2- Develop Mortality Prediction Models using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. 
3- Explore whether gender impacts the importance of different features and the performance of the mortality prediction models.

# Conclusion:

After applying Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest methods and analyze the dataset, based on the objectives, the project ended up with the mortality prediction model using Random Forest. 
Also, by using Sklearn method of roc_curve() and computing roc auc score, we can plot the ROC curves for the 3  algorithms. It is evident from the plot that the AUC for the Random Forest ROC curve is higher than that for the Decision Tree and Logistic curve. Therefore, we can say that Random Forest did a better job of classifying the positive class in the dataset.
