# Heart Failure Mortality Prediction Objectives

1- Determine the most essential features that are linked with mortality due to heart failure.

2- Develop Mortality Prediction Models using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. 

3- Explore whether gender impacts the importance of different features and the performance of the mortality prediction models.

# Conclusion:

After applying Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest methods and analyze the dataset, based on the objectives, the project ended up with the mortality prediction model using Random Forest which:
Is 85.5% accurate to classifying the patients as dead or survived (Accuracy Score of 0.833)
Predicted 80.8% correctly for predicting mortality (Recall Score of 0.692)
Out of all mortality prediction 72.4% is truly mortality (Precision Score of 0.72)
is performing 89.6% well (ROC AUC Score of 0.896)
